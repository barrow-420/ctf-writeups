In the labs, you will be required to do the following:

- Skill
  
- Programming Exercises
  
  - *Basic Exercises*

  - **Advanced Exercises**
  
- <ins>Demo Projects</ins>

THis table is just for reference:

| **Contents**       | **Percentage** |
|:--------------- | ------- |
| Basic Exercises          | 50%-60%      |
| Advanced Exercises        | 20%      |
| Attendance   | 10%    |
| Skill | 0%-10%    |
| Demo Project | 0%-20% |

## How to ~~survive~~ learn well in the lab?

Perhaps here's some suggestions:

1. Follow the lab instructions.
2. Seek for help if necessary.
3. Finish the lab exercises in time.

## Sample Code

In the programming exercise part, you will be asked to write good `code` in `MATLAB`, `C` and `C++`. For instance,

```
function d=density(r,c,T) %Think about what this function mean!
G=6.674*10^-11;
V=4*pi/3*(c/(2*pi))^3;
M=4*pi^2*r^3/(G*T^2);
d=M/V;
end
```

## Other comments...
\- You may also need to be good at \_\_mathematics\_\_.

\- But of course we will not ask you to calculate $\int \sqrt{tan(x)}dx$.

\- The following suggestion is from Dr. Manuel Charlemagne
