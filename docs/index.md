## Let's Go

This repo was made so that I can share my write-ups for security Capture The Flags, wargames, or similar exercises.

Also, I will be uploading various technology related topics that I am interested in. 

This kind of my personal diary, using this repo I make recordings of myself and improve my write-ups skills.

If you are the owner of a CTF/wargame and would like me to remove a write-up, please create an issue and I will do so.
