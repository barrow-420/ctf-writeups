# SJTU VPN
## Short Story

SJTU runs a VPN for students and teachers.

As a freshman at SJTU, I also got access to the VPN but found out it only works on Mac and Windows.

Cuz I am a Linux (Ubuntu) user, I decided that I should make changes so I can use the VPN on Ubuntu.

I hoped there is a version made for Linux-executable, but there isn't.

Honestly, although I play CTF, I am very beginner so I think I will be spending future few days studying and working to make this happen.

Glad, that I am facing a new challenge and will be fully concentrated!
