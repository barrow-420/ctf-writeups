# SimpleCTF
It was my first time playing CTF on tryhackme and I am a very beginner at this, so I decided to go with the easiest looking one.
SimpleCTF is a beginner level CTF but it was still very hard for me. 
To be honest, I had a peek at the walkthrough few times once I got stuck.
My walkthrough is little bit different from what others have done because I had a python version and module issue, so I had to change my point of view.

Task 1&2
I first had to do nmap scan. 
nmap -vvv -sS -sV -oN initial 10.10.51.175
