# Let's go
This repo was made so that I can share my write-ups for security Capture The Flags, wargames, or similar exercises.

This is not a expert level writeups. 

This is more likely a simple journal of my voyage to mastery. 

Keep in mind that content written might be incorect.

If you are the owner of a CTF/wargame and would like me to remove a write-up, please create an issue and I will do so.
